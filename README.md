# HUGO site Continuous Deployment using AWS s3
I created this repo as part of @noahgift's [Cloud Computing Foundations Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing-foundations-duke/home/welcome). Use this code along with the below deployment guide to spin up a basic static HUGO site in the cloud.

Link to site: *TODO: add link*
## Overview

## Deployment
A. Fork and clone this repo

B. Setup s3 bucket with proper permissions

C. Create new CodeBuild build project that hooks to your repo
